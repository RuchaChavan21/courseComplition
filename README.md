# Course Completion Tracker

## Introduction
The Course Completion Tracker is a smart contract built on the Aptos blockchain that provides a proof-of-completion system for educational courses. It allows administrators to set up course tracking and enables students to mark courses as completed.

## Vision
The goal of this project is to create a decentralized and transparent system for tracking course completions. By leveraging the Aptos blockchain, the project aims to provide a tamper-resistant and auditable record of student achievements, empowering educational institutions and learners alike.

## Future Goals
- Integrate the tracker with existing educational platforms and learning management systems.
- Explore the use of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to represent course completion certificates.
- Develop a user-friendly dashboard for administrators and students to monitor course progress and achievements.
- Implement advanced analytics and reporting features to provide insights into course completion trends.
- Explore the possibility of using the tracker for professional development, corporate training, and other life-long learning scenarios.
